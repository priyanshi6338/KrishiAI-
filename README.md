KrishiAI

ML-based Soil Fertility Prediction Model

⸻

Overview

KrishiAI is a machine learning project focussed on predicting soil fertility using various soil parameters. The goal is to help farmers and agriculture specialists estimate soil health and nutrient levels, enabling better crop planning and fertilizer application.

Contents

File / Item	Description
KrishiAI.ipynb	The main Jupyter notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
Raw Data Soil Fettility.csv	Original/raw data for soil fertility (as provided).
soil data.csv	Preprocessed / working version of the soil data used for modelling.


⸻

Features
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on soil parameters (like pH, organic content, nutrients, etc.).
	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, scaling, etc.
	•	Building one or more predictive models (e.g. regression or classification) to assess soil fertility.
	•	Model evaluation with metrics suited to the task.
	•	Visualization of results for better interpretability.

⸻

How to Use
	1.	Set up the environment
Install Python and required packages. E.g.:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


	2.	Load Data
Use the notebook to load Raw Data Soil Fettility.csv.
	3.	Explore & Clean Data
Check for missing values, outliers, inconsistent entries, etc.
	4.	Train Model
Apply appropriate ML algorithms (could be Random Forests, Decision Trees, or others) to predict soil fertility labels / scores.
	5.	Evaluate Model
Use train/test split or cross‐validation. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall (if classification), or error metrics if regression.
	6.	Use Model
Once a satisfactory model is developed, provide new soil parameter inputs to get predictions.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (you may add more if used in the notebook)

⸻

Possible Improvements / Next Steps
	•	Add feature engineering: derive new features from existing soil parameters.
	•	Try multiple ML models and compare (e.g. ensemble methods).
	•	Hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
	•	Deploy model as a web app or API for easier access.
	•	Expand dataset with more soil samples / geographical diversity.
	•	Add interpretability tools (feature importance, SHAP, etc.).
